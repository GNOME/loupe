# NEWS

The [`NEWS`](../NEWS) file is automatically generated from this directory.

Please add a file for each changelog entry to the subolder corresponding to the version. Usually, this will be the latest version that has a folder. The files begin with a category prefix like `changed-` or `fixed-`. The prefixes follow the categories from [keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

The NEWS files needs to be generated via `./build-aux/generate-news.py` and commited before releases.
