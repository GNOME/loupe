## 49.0 (2025-09-12)

### Fixed

- `F9 <Alt>Return` accel not being parsed correctly

## 49.rc (2025-08-28)

## 49.beta (2025-08-01)

### Changed

- Updated dependencies

## 49.alpha (2025-07-02)

### Changed

- Use glycin loaders with API 2+

## 48.1 (2025-04-11)

### Fixed

- Crash when closing the window, probably in the exact moment when the animnation for hiding controls starts.
- Editing does not work correctly if PNGs or JPEGs are already rotated via an Exif orientation entry before editing.
- Printed pages don't contain anything or garbled output. This is a temporary workaround for <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/7464>, using the cairo renderer for the rotation and scaling of the image in the print preparation.

## 48.0 (2025-03-14)

### Fixed

- edit/crop: Pre-select the portrait orientation for images that are taller than wide.

## 48.rc (2025-02-28)

### Fixed

- Decide if an image has a format that supports editing based on the reliable mime-type. That way a wrong file extension will not impact the detection of the format being editable.
- Set description instead of title for general errors, showing the complete and correct message.
- Switch to consitently storing rotation with CCW convention.
- editing/crop: Allow do decrease size of crop selection from edges when fixed aspect ratio is used.
- editing: Don't show error if saving is aborted. Instead handle actual errors correctly.

### Changed

- editing/crop: Change icons for aspect ratio buttons for portrait orientation.
- editing/crop: Disambiguate and tweak icons for crop selection aspect ratio buttons.

## 48.beta (2025-01-31)

### Added

- edit/crop: Add back the selection of the aspect ratio for aspect ratios.
- edit/crop: Added keyboard shortcuts for some editing operations.
- edit/crop: Allow dragging selection from the edges, not only the corners.
- edit/crop: Apply crop selections on operations like rotate/flip or save.
- edit: Add menu with option to "Save As" or overwrite original.
- edit: Allow to cancel saving operation via the "Cancel" button.
- edit: Give visual feedback while saving image via spinner overlay.
- edit: Show saved image after saving.
- edit: `Ctrl+S` and `Ctrl+Shift+S` shortcuts save images and `Esc` to exit the editing view.

### Fixed

- Disable all zoom buttons and editing button if image fails to load.
- Fix allocation warnings by not causing resizes during allocation.
- edit/crop: Set aspect ratio to "Free" on reset.
- edit/crop: Work around GTK gesture bug that blocks the drag gesture after clicking the apply button until one additional click has been done.
- edit: Disable save actions when saving or no changes have been done.

### Changed

- edit/crop: Enable the "Reset" button when the crop selection change, even if not applied.
- edit/crop: Move crop apply button into crop selection as small checkmark.
- edit/crop: Refactor a lot of the inner working to make code simpler and more robust.
- edit: Add an "(Edited)" suffix to the suggested filename when using "Save As"
- edit: Various design and detail tweaks.
- zoom: Allow zoom levels smaller than best fit via the zoom menu.

## 47.4 (2025-01-13)

### Fixed

- Sometimes SVGs are not shown in the print preview.

## 48.alpha (2025-01-07)

### Added

- Display XMP metadata for JPEG images.
- Initial support for image editing of JPEGs and PNGs with crop, rotate, and flip.
- Show the correct folder name in the properties view inside flatpaks if the file is only accessible via portal.
- User comment field in metadata.

### Fixed

- The sort order is now also following the one found in Files (Nautilus) if the file name contains non-ascii characters.

### Changed

- The design of the overlay buttons, especially for zoom controls has been reworked. A new menu supports selecting from pre-defined zoom levels as well as entering a specific zoom level.

## 47.2 (2024-11-22)

### Fixed

- Don't call style manager in application constructor since this is too early. Do it in startup instead. Without this fix, GTK 4.17.0 will terminate the app on startup.

## 47.1 (2024-10-16)

### Added

- Add `<branding><color>`s instead of just using `GnomeSoftware::key-colors`. That they weren't set was an oversight.

### Fixed

- Make the string "Error Details" translatable.
- Require glycin 2.0.1 crate to detect SVGZ files properly.

## 47.0 (2024-09-13)

### Fixed

- Flickering while images are reloaded. Instead, keep the old textures around until a new texture is available.
- Forcing the zoom to the center of the image is now working again. This is especially noticable when using the touchpads pinch gesture.
- When disabling animations in the OS and using the buttons to change the image, the wrong image was shown, disabling features like zoom.

## 47.beta.1 (2024-08-13)

### Fixed

- Don't force Flatpak sandbox SVGs. This fixes SVGs not loading outside of Flatpak.
- Make the window wider when it would open with a bottom-sheet overlay for properties. That way, the properties can be shown in a sidebar.
- Properly detect non-transparent images and down download a thumbnail for background detection for them. For some reason, the thumbnail download is using a lot of VRAM.
- Rotating a freshly opened image would not follow the best-fit scaling.
- Rotating by 0 degrees went through the complete rotation pipeline including a image reload. Now, 0 deg rotations are ignored.

## 47.beta (2024-08-02)

### Added

- Add reload button to errors and F5 as reload shortcut

### Fixed

- Don't show error-screen if SVG has been loaded and only the rendering for tiles for other zoom levels fails. Instead, show the already loaded tiles.
- Fixed that some actions are available on error pages and loading screens while they are not actually useful. This includes actions like zoom, rotate, and print.
- No longer empty the animation buffer if next frame isn't available yet. This removes flickering for larger and high FPS animations on slower systems.
- Zoom into viewport center via buttons. Before, the image center was used, which would cause a jump if the viewport had been changed.

### Changed

- Changed the drag and drop overlay to use accent colors instead of a fixed color. This also makes it follow the new adjustable accent colors.
- Don't emmediately show the spinner for loading images. This avoids fresh spinners showing up each time when switching through images very quickly via keyboard.
- Make strings that contain `\u{<hex>}` translatable
- No longer overwrite GTKs default renderer with 'gl'. The latest patches in GTK seem to make the Vulkan renderer work fine.
- The properties no longer use the deprecated AdwFlap widget. For very small windows, properties are now shown in an AdwBottomSheet.
- Use AdwSpinner when loading images.
- Use glycin's auto detection of development mode to disable sandbox.

## 47.alpha (2024-06-28)

### Added

- Rotating JPEG images with an orientation Exif entry will now change that entry
