All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can
be statically proven to be within array bounds.  More details can be found in

determinism across the update would be broken.

The new constants do appear to match WyRand v4.2 (modulo ordering issues that I have not checked):
