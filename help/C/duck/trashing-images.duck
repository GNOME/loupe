  [topic]
@link[guide >index#additional-features]

@desc Move unwanted images to the trash directly from Image Viewer.

If a user wants to remove an image, they can press the $gui(Move To Trash)
($media[type="image" src="figures/user-trash-symbolic.svg"](user-trash-symbolic))
button. A toast will appear allowing them to restore the image with the $gui(Undo)
button.
